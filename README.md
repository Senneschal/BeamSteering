# BeamSteering
The topic of my Bachelor Graduation Porject is: Laser beam steering using liquid crystals <br>
The goal of this project was to apply electrical potentials to a thin liquid crystal such that a linear profile in refractive index is optained such that an incoming laser beam can be steered at will over time. Rather than simply experimentally determining the required voltage profile we used MATLAB simulation. A relatively good relation was found between the theoretical model and the measurements.
